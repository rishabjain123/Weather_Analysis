find the number of time whne the wind speed as excactly 4km/h?
find the null values in the data?
rename the column name 'weather' to 'weather condition'
what is the mean visiblity?
what is the standard deviation of pressure column?
what is the variance of relative humidity?
find all the instances when 'snow' was recorded?
find all the instances when wind speed is 24 and visibility is 25?
what is sum value of each column against each weather condition?
what is the min value of each column against each weather condition?
find all the instances when weather is clear or visibility is 40?
